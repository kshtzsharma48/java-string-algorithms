### About

A collection of various string-related algorithm implementations in Java.

### Implemented

* Boyer-Moore
* Knuth-Morris-Pratt
* Longest Palindrome

### Coming Soon

* Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
* Longest Common Substring

### Ideas

* Annotations to document behaviors (Exact char match vs. equivalence (handling accents), Case sensitivity, etc)
* Generic interface (Handle sequences of arbitrary objects, not just characters)
